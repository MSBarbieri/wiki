i believe that a desktop should be a living thing, always changing, adding new scripts, reorganizing projects, moving apps and etc.

but not always i remember all the stuff i add, remove and where they are, so i list all of them here and why i use them, beyond that i will link my configs and try to make them updated to become reproducable by anyone who wants to use one or even all stuff i have in
my environment.
